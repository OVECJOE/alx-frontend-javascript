# ES6 PROMISE

Promises is one of the features that was included into EcmaScript 2015. And it helps avoid "callbacks hell" &mdash; When you have nested callback functions &mdash; that existed with the use of callbacks.

Promises are used with asynchronous JS and are difficult to understand at first, but becomes much more fun to use at mastery.
